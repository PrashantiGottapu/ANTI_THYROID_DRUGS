Chapter 1: Anti_thyroid_drug
  Antithyroid drugs (also called thionamides) are most often used to treat an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) caused by Graves' disease. These drugs block the formation of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland (figure 1). (See "Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)".)

Antithyroid drugs are very effective for treating hyperthyroidism. They also have some side effects. It is important to learn as much as possible about the treatment of Graves' disease and to discuss all of the possible effects of antithyroid drugs with your health care provider so you can determine which treatment is best for you.

Chapter 2: Alpha Blocks
Therapy is aimed at (1) ameliorating hyperadrenergic effects of thyroid hormone (TH) on peripheral tissues with use of beta-blockers (eg, propranolol, labetalol); (2) decreasing further synthesis of THs with antithyroid medications (eg, propylthiouracil [PTU], methimazole); (3) decreasing hormonal release from the thyroid, using iodides; and (4) preventing further TH secretion and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, using glucocorticoids or iodinated radiocontrast dyes when available.
